# TrackerTournament from Tim Corey
I decided to follow along with Tim's incredible video about Creating a C# Application from start to finish
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfWxdh-_k_4 here is the link. 
All code copied from Tim as i was following along with the video. 

This includes all the code from Interfaces, to SQL, to Emailing.
